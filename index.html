        <p>You've swallowed a planet! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.  They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
