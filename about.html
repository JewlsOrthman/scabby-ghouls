         <p>LOUIE HAZARD: Lead Guitar and Backup Vocals. I am iron man Has he lost his mind? Can he see or is he blind? Can he walk at all Or if he moves will he fall? Is he alive or dead? Has he thoughts within his head? We'll just pass him there Why should we even care? He was turned to steel In the great magnetic field Where he traveled time For the future of mankind Nobody wants him He just stares at the world</p><br><br>

         <p>NATHAN CHRISTENSEN: Drummer. Planning his vengeance That he will soon unfold Now the time is here For iron man to spread fear Vengeance from the grave Kills the people he once saved Nobody wants him They just turn their heads Nobody helps him Now he has his revenge Heavy boots of lead Fills his victims full of dread Running as fast as they can Iron man lives again</p>
